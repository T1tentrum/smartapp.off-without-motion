smartapp.off-without-motion
===========================

This app is designed to be a "smarter" version of the *Darken Behind Me* app.

The original *Darken Behind Me* app was designed for walking and did not
adapt well to sitting in a room.  As the motion detection was is not all
that finely grained, sitting in a room reading a book (for example) may
not trigger the motion.

So, this version allows for a configurable grace period before turning off
the lights so that the motion detection can have a chance to catch you
moving.

If the device catches you moving within the grace period, much like your
computer screen-saver app, it will restart the countdown clock.
